import Darwin // pow()


// TO DO: what about UInt? how important to support that too? it's possible entoli integers could support UInt.min..<UInt.max as maximum integer range by storing negation as a flag, though that could make math significantly more painful)
// TO DO: Int is 32-bit on non-64-bit systems, and [U]Int64 [presumably] isn't available, so need to rejig Scalar<->UInt[32/64] code to take that into account; also need to give some thought as to how to ensure 32-bit compatibility throughout (annoyingly, Swift stdlib doesn't define a standard generics-friendly protocol for instantiating all Integer and FloatingPoint types, so each needs to be implemented separately just to keep type system happy)


// TO DO: how to modularize this numerical parsing (e.g. as composable/chainable funcs) to allow easy construction of more complex pattern matching (e.g. canonical dates and times); also, how should complex structures such as dates be detected and matched? (ideally they'd be another form of suffix, being pattern matched on separator char, though whether such funcs should be passed for tail calling with accummulated data as arg or nested in composition remains to be decided) (note that while new function breakdown is better for reuse, it still isn't composable as there isn't a single standard API across them all: that would require e.g. passing a struct containing whatever info has been accummulated so far so that each subsequent func can decide what to do next)

// TO DO: both prefixes and suffixes should be pre-defined (avoids any confusion with operator chars appearing in suffix being read as part of that suffix); bonus: it should be possible to predefine them using a simple Dictionary<String,String> (aliases to canonical name; or to whatever eventually represents unit types); might need 2 dicts if doing separate prefix/suffix, given that prefixes are much more restrictive than suffixes (to avoid collisions with unquoted names, only dedicated symbols should be used, e.g. `$`, whereas suffixes could be almost anything, e.g. `USD`)



// TO DO: once typespecs are implemented, these functions may become static methods on numeric typespecs

// note: in typespecs, Texts that aren't numbers could be annotated as Numeric.NotNumber the first time a numeric scan fails, eliminating need to rescan should that value be [unsuccessfully] coerced again

// TO DO: manipulating currency as doubles is not ideal; while it probably doesn't hurt to store numerical value as Scalar.FloatingPoint representation, coercion handlers and commands that deal specifically with currency values may want to ignore that and use [e.g.] NSDecimal instead


// Q. regarding chainable parsefuncs, these would need to accept and return (ScriptChars,ScriptIndex,Result), where Result is a struct/class/whatever; the challenge is how to describe that Result, e.g. using multiple protocols, each specific to a particular parsefunc, that allow parsefunc to transform existing result and or attach additional info to it without knowing any details of how it's actually implemented (Q. how to type it, e.g. generic funcs? thus Result's type going in and out would be <ReturnType where ReturnType: SpecificProtocol>)


// TO DO: how practical to support localization in code? (it'd require an explicit locale declaration at top of file to eliminate guesswork, and supported locales would likely have to be hardcoded as comma/period overloading can impact lexer/parser behavior)


// TO DO: if canonical time has `HH:MM[:SS][TZ]` format (which it pretty much needs to), parser will need to take care not to confuse that for pair(s); as with `YYYY-MM-DD` dates, it's a case of numeric parsefunc looking for the longest match, and yielding to standard parser only if that exact form isn't found (thus even a minor, fairly natural change such as parenthesizing or spacing disrupts the 'special' form; BTW, formatter will need to take this into account too, and ensure it never outputs ambiguous forms, thus all of these numeric forms will need to be fixed and hardcoded in core, even if they're implemented internally as pluggable parsefuncs)

 Notes:
 
 - read funcs should be called in the following order:

     readNumberSign
     readUnitPrefix
     readHexadecimalNumber
     readDecimalNumber
     readUnitSuffix

// TO DO: should this always digest multiple sign (+/-) prefixes? (in code, they'd just be prefix ops otherwise, so it does no harm; not sure about text-to-number casts though - typespecs might want to pass an optional flag to disallow this 'sloppiness' and ensure no more than one sign char is allowed; typespecs should also wrap this call in a function that ignores leading+trailing whitespace, and fails if the input is not fully consumed)

// TO DO: also return normalized representation (either as string or as struct of component parts: prefixSign, prefixUnit, number, etc)? this'd allow pretty printer to tidy up excess signs and put signs and prefix units into consistent order

// TO DO: this needs to differentiate between non-number and malformed number (i.e. basic numeric syntax is a hardcoded special case, so any word that starts with a recognized digit but then violates the rules, e.g. by having both prefix and suffix units, or by having too many decimal points, or too many exponents, etc. should be flagged as malformed so that it cannot be subsequently read as an unquoted name or operator)
