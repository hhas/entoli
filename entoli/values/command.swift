OTOH expanding Name as a Command here currently breaks parameter record parsing (it likely also breaks stuff elsewhere), though that's probably a defect in the RecordSignature constraint or similar, which should be asking for known arg types in the first place. One possibility would for `Value` to provide separate `call()` and `expand()` methods, the first of which to be called in command contexts (e.g. expression sequence, list pair), the other in value contexts (e.g. record pair, `store` pair).

// command


// TO DO: commands could (and should) have lighter-weight structure, storing name as String and args as [Value] (record access methods could be provided via protocol extension, or by having Command subclass Record); the one caveat being that normalized names are required for binding whereas non-normalized names should be retained for display -- for now, just KISS; implement public APIs as composing Value types (as that's the abstraction that symbolic metaprogramming uses), and worry about optimized APIs/internal representations later.


class Command: Value {
    // note that while a Command value has a pair-based structure, it doesn't subclass Pair as its behavior is _not_ substitutable (i.e. if the user passes a command where a pair is expected, the user expects the command to perform the corresponding procedure which then returns a pair value, not be dismantled into a `Name:AnyOrNothing` pair itself); i.e. when deciding on whether one Value should subclass another, both API substitutability _and_ behavioral substitutability must be guaranteed (i.e. don't want to get into embarrassing situations such as NSArray vs NSMutableArray where the latter guarantees the same API as the former but does _not_ guarantee the same behavior, since an NSMutableArray's contents may change at any time, including while it's being used in code that assumes its immutability since it asked for an NSArray).

        self.name = name
        self.key = name.string.lowercased()
