// TO DO: ideally generic procs shouldn't have to include `Constraint` requirement, only `SwiftCast`/`NativeConstraint` protocol: if a constraint needs to be stored in a property, convert it to a `NativeConstraint` first (storing it as a `Constraint` is semi-useless anyway, as it severely limits what can be done with it, and is effectively useless for tagging Values as it'll need to be converted to a native constraint before it can be used - assuming it can be easily boxed, that conversion can still be deferred at cost of an extra object alloc that can be ameliorated anyway thru caching...or just go straight to native constraint, which costs the same, where available, and treat any coercions that don't have native equivalents as opaque and have an OpaqueValue for representing them, which should do the same thing; the only issue being unpacking them again which is a pig when they're a generic type as those aren't amenable to casts where exact type isn't known)


// TO DO: LiteralName? this'd allow us to distinguish a Name that MAY BE evaled as an arg-less command, when in an applicable context (e.g. exprseq), vs a Name that MUST always eval as a name (e.g. record field name). Note that most of the fuzziness centers around LHS of Pair values. Might even be worth putting the onus on Pair.

// Q. how should expanded values indicate that they don't need expanded again? (this sort of ties in with the Name problem)

// Q. what about `MustBeName` (always evals as name) vs `MayBeName` (evals as name or command; calling context decides)? (FixedName/FlexibleName?)

// what about Name vs ExpandedName; the latter would always eval to self; the former as command unless NameConstraint is specified (in which case it expands to ExpandedName); for a record field, the parser would emit ExpandedName (it already special-cases pairs in [some] exprseqs as `store{VALUE,NAME}` so shouldn't need to worry about that, though can still convert name to expanded name to be sure); note: should `(NAME)` eval as command where NameConstraint is specified, or should user be required to write `NAME{}` to explicitly disambiguate? Could be fiddly; consider procs that take a name as parameter, and how a literal(?) name arg is best disambiguated from a command. (One could argue the need for `NAME{}` is self-evident, and parens should not change meaning of `NAME`; the flipside, of course, is where parens are used to group multiple exprs...though one could argue parens only ever group atomic values [which an exprseq is], in which case adding/removing parens should never modify meaning. In which case meaning of `NAME:VALUE` is always `store` except in value contexts, e.g. record, kv-list). Mind, to put an exprseq in a record, it _must_ be parensed [or do...done, assuming that works syntactically].

    // TO DO: for entoli literal representation, this needs to escape any `'` chars within self.string; in addition, quotes should be omitted if unnecessary (impractical here, since `description` var knows nothing about where it's being used, but full renderer will be able to track details such as nesting depth and lexical context)

    override func _expandAsAny_(_ env: Scope) throws -> Value { return self }
//  override func _expandAsAny_(_ env: Scope) throws -> Value { return try self.toCommand() } // (EXPERIMENTAL; currently doesn't work either) TO DO: returning Name here is problematic when the name appears in an expression context where it should be treated as an arg-less command. OTOH expanding Name as a Command here currently breaks parameter record parsing (it likely also breaks stuff elsewhere), though that's probably a defect in the RecordSignature constraint or similar, which should be asking for known arg types in the first place. One possibility would for `Value` to provide separate `call()` and `expand()` methods, the first of which to be called in command contexts (e.g. expression sequence, list pair), the other in value contexts (e.g. record pair, `store` pair). // CAUTION: this is likely subtly wrong: entoli should respect any valid program, even one directly constructed as data rather than parsed from code; thus is a Name:Value Pair appears in a List it should remain as-is - as an item in an ordered/unique list, not a key-value pair in a key-value list. IOW, the parser should track context.

//**********************************************************************
// command


// TO DO: commands could (and should) have lighter-weight structure, storing name as String and args as [Value] (record access methods could be provided via protocol extension, or by having Command subclass Record); the one caveat being that normalized names are required for binding whereas non-normalized names should be retained for display -- for now, just KISS; implement public APIs as composing Value types (as that's the abstraction that symbolic metaprogramming uses), and worry about optimized APIs/internal representations later.


class Command: Value {
    // note that while a Command value has a pair-based structure, it doesn't subclass Pair as its behavior is _not_ substitutable (i.e. if the user passes a command where a pair is expected, the user expects the command to perform the corresponding procedure which then returns a pair value, not be dismantled into a `Name:AnyOrNothing` pair itself); i.e. when deciding on whether one Value should subclass another, both API substitutability _and_ behavioral substitutability must be guaranteed (i.e. don't want to get into embarrassing situations such as NSArray vs NSMutableArray where the latter guarantees the same API as the former but does _not_ guarantee the same behavior, since an NSMutableArray's contents may change at any time, including while it's being used in code that assumes its immutability since it asked for an NSArray).
