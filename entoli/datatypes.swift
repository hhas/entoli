class TextValue: Value { // TO DO: how to annotate with numerics, units, dates, etc? (data detectors might output primitive [Swift] values automatically, in which case they should prob. be cached in TextValue for efficient reuse, avoiding need to coerce Text to primitives each time); alternatively, TextValue _might_ be subclassed as NumberValue (which in turn might be subclassed as NumericUnitsValue), DateValue, etc., at least for built-ins

class ExpressionGroupValue: Value { // TO DO: can/should these be omitted where not needed? also, need to think carefully about allowing multiple expressions (punctuation-based grouping is kinda needed as `do...done` blocks are only available if that operator is loaded); one possibility is for expression groups to coerce differently depending on whether they contain one or arbitrary no. of expressions; thus a math operator would ask for `number` and would throw coercion error if passed `(do evil. 2)`, and only asking for commands would accept it (e.g. `if{bool,commands}`)

    // TO DO: add `hasPrefixData:Bool` to indicate first arg is piped via `;` from previous command (in which case we can get rid of PipeValue entirely and just make sure it casts its right operand to CommandValue before setting that flag)? or should evaluator always pass previous command's result along with flag provided by PipeValue telling command whether or not to use it as its first arg? (note: passing previous result might be obligatory if implementing Icon-style success/failure model, since [Test]Failed is just another result that needs to be passed along each command in remaining sequence until handled or returned)
    // TO DO: `postfixData` (where last arg is expression group supplied by postfix `do...done`)

class PipeValue: Value {// TO DO: needed? or should CommandValue have slot for this? (caution: recursively traversing linked lists of commands in order to eval them is a surefire way to blow Swift stack; a safer way would be for evaluator to start at head, and have each command return the next command to eval [on success]; that said, the simplest strategy would be to get rid of PipeValue and just set a flag on the RH command telling it to consume the current output value [which the evaluator always captures as the result of the previous command] as its first arg â€” this also avoids complexity/confusion of some commands being items in group array and others being their own linked lists; only thing we need to check is a piped command can never consume input that wasn't actually meant for it)
